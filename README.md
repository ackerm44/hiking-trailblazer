# Hiking Trailblazer

## The hiking app for tracking the trails you've trekked

Hiking Trailblazer allows you to create an account to track the trails that you have hiked so far.  Trails
are related to a geographical region.  Users can see trails that other users have hiked, add trail to their 
own account by adding a new trail or selecting from a trail already added by another user. 


To use this app:

1.  Fork and clone
2.  Bundle install
3.  Run rake db:migrate
4.  Run shotgun to preview
